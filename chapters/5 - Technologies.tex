\chapter{Technologies}

Pie's technologies were chosen with maintainability in mind. I have integrated various technologies and third-party libraries already used in popular mature open-source projects. Such technologies are backed up by large communities and frequent updates, confirming that they will not become obsolete in the near future.

\section{Microsoft's Windows Forms and the .NET Framework}

THE .NET Framework was introduced in 2001 by Microsoft, together with the Visual Studio tool. It was built for the purpose to simplify Windows application development \cite{net-framework}, currently supporting three languages, also developed by Microsoft: Visual Basic, a user interface adaptation of the BASIC language, C\#, and F\#.

Pie uses Windows Forms (commonly referred to as "WinForms"), as the primary technology for its graphical user interface and business logic. WinForms is a technology that was introduced with the first version of .NET. It "can be thought of as a wrapper around the complex Win32 API" \cite{winforms-history}. The solution 
simplified desktop development by allowing programmers to focus on the business logic, instead of coding user interface components. Components, officially known as "Controls", could be added to application windows (or "Forms") simply by dragging and dropping them on the workbench.

Although not the first WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") designer, Windows Forms is certainly one of the most popular ones, as it came directly from Microsoft, the developer of Windows, receiving frequent updates and support even to this day. It is also available for all of the three .NET languages. I have chosen C\#, as it is the most commonly used among them.

WinForms is not the only user interface technology developed by Microsoft. Several years later, in 2006, Windows Presentation Foundations ("WPF") has been introduced, followed by the Universal Windows Platform ("UWP") technology in 2015. Although the latter provide a more actual way of splitting user interface logic and business logic, Windows Forms received more support during the years, is simpler to use, and has more compatible extensions ready to be integrated. Windows Forms is also considered to be a better option, from a memory management point of view. Performance is also a key to be taken into consideration, and in this manner, it seems that there is no significant difference between newer technologies such as WPF and WinForms \cite{han2023optimization}. Even so, the Form components inside Pie do not incorporate a large number of controls (e.g. buttons, textboxes, labels, panels) and the file handling logic is as simple and possible, using actual C\# integrated methods. Thus, the application is not expected to cause any slow-downs during the start-up or the usage of it.

The "Form" control is a representation of any window displayed in an application. The Form class can be used to create standard, floating and borderless windows. The "Properties" panel (present in any type of Control object), can be used to determine the appearance, size, color and window management features of the windows or dialog boxes that are created. \cite{form-class}

\end{figure}

Controls (available in the "Toolbox" sidebar of the designer) can have certain "Events" attached to them. Events can be triggered on several occasions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item a mouse is hovered over the control;
  \item the control is clicked;
  \item someone presses a key, while holding focus on the control. 
\end{enumerate}

Pie uses a large number of event handlers, being able to respond to certain key bindings accordingly. Thus, users can toggle different user interface components such as the Find\&Replace dialog or the integrated terminal system simply by pressing a predefined key combination. 

The NuGet pacakge manager, integrated into Visual Studio, is the most effective and secure way to add external libraries to a .NET project. It provides a large collection of packages built by developers, including file parsers, user interface components, or database drivers, ready to be bundled into the application.

\section{Third-party libraries included with Pie}
\subsection{Redesigning .NET components with Krypton and ObjectListView}

Even though WinForms offers a vast toolbox of controls and customization options, it still has its limitations when it comes to design of native Windows elements. While most of the components can be customized, this typically requires writing complex event handling logic and overriding methods from the framework's base classes. In order to minimize the default Windows look in my application, I have integrated a third-party library called Krypton \cite{krypton}.

Krypton provides a better way to personalize the overall design of WinForms controls through the integration of the "KryptonPalette" class. A singleton instance of this class is accessible from all components in the application, including forms, panels, buttons, and labels. I have defined a general color scheme and other design aspects, such as border rounding and label font size, and have configured all project components to inherit their properties from this singleton.

Another limitation of Windows Forms is the ListView control. A ListView is used to display multiple elements in a list \cite{listview}, being able to handle events such as mouse clicks, mouse hovers, and key presses. However, neither the native ListBox integrated into Visual Studio nor Krypton's implementation of the ListView offers the level of customization needed for my application. To address this, I have integrated the ObjectListView \cite{objectlistview} library into the project.

ObjectListView allows for the mapping of actual objects (not just strings) to ListView controls, and offers a way to assign icons or specific colors to each element based on specific fields. This "Object-to-ListView" mapping was a requirement for Pie, as the control is used to display the status of the files in Git repositories, the list of custom build commands, and the database connections added to the application.

\subsection{Relying on Newtonsoft.Json to parse configuration files}

Pie stores configuration files such as color scheme definitions and Git credentials in JSON-formatted files. JSON is preferred over popular formats like XML, when simple data is transmitted, and the focus is on the data handling performance \cite{json-vs-xml}.

Whenever the user does a change in the configuration of the application, a JSON file needs to be rewritten. In the same manner, whenever Pie is started, the entire configuration specified in the JSON files needs to be loaded internally. A proper way of handling these files is through the Newtonsoft.Json \cite{newtonsoft-json} parsing library.

Newtonsoft.Json is used to deserialize (read) JSON files into internal configuration objects and to serialize (write) these objects back into JSON files in an efficient manner, without introducing any noticeable temporal overhead.

\subsection{Integrating the code editing functionality with Scintilla}

The most used control, the actual code editor, is an instance of ScintillaNET \cite{scintillanet}, a C\# wrapper implemented over the famous Scintilla \cite{scintilla}, also used by Notepad++ and Code::Blocks.

Scintilla is an advanced code editing component that can be customized up to anyone's preferences, providing syntax highlighting, code folding, line numbering and code breakpoints. It was developed and released by Neil Hodgson in 1999 and it is still being maintained to this day. 

ScintillaNET provides a better and easier way to integrate Scintilla inside .NET applications, being fully intended for the Windows Forms platform. This aspect can be used as a solid argument to justify my decision of using WinForms as Pie's GUI framework. Several pre-defined Scintilla lexers were already integrated inside the library (e.g. C, Python, Lua), and I have additionally included code from other open-source lexers. Syntax highlighting for languages similar to C, such as Java, use the pre-defined C lexer, but I have modified the list of keywords, based on official documentation found online \cite{java-keywords}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/scite.png}
\caption{Scintilla's syntax highlighting capabilities in the SciTE editor}
\label{fig:fig2,1.}
\end{figure}

Syntax highlighting may not be enough for some developers, and with this in mind, I have also integrated autocomplete functionality for the languages supported by Pie. This has been made possible through the AutoCompleteMenu-ScintillaNET \cite{autocompletemenu} library. It suggests autocomplete for the keywords of a specific language, identified by the extension of the opened file.

\subsection{Terminal instance management using ConEmu}

Pie allows users to manage an unlimited number of terminal instances during their working session. At this moment, developers are only able to automatically launch Command Prompt or PowerShell processes, but navigating through other terminals (such as bash) is possible through the command line. Output of custom builds is also redirected to an integrated terminal instance, with a new window created every time the user clicks on a saved build command.

This functionality was made possible by adding the ConEmu Inside \cite{conemu-inside} package, an extension of the popular ConEmu \cite{conemu} terminal for Windows. ConEmu is a free open-source terminal emulator launched in 2007, that was initially intended as a companion to a mature file manager for Windows. It sparked interest two decades ago with its capability to bypass several standard Windows console host features, being still used to this day.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Using CefSharp and Markdig for rendering code inside web browsers}

Pie provides a rendering functionality that displays HTML code in a web browser window, integrated directly inside the application. Although Microsoft's native web browser API for WinForms is able to receive HTML code and render it, it isn't updated regularly and doesn't handle JavaScript well. The engine used for .NET's WebBrowser control is based on the old Internet Explorer. For this purpose, I have used CefSharp \cite{cefsharp}, a C\# wrapper over the Chromium framework, that allows an efficient way of operating on web pages, thanks to its multithreaded implementation \cite{mohamed2022performance}.

I have also provided Markdown rendering support, as it continues to become more popular during the years. Due to CefSharp not being able to directly render Markdown code inside a web browser instance, the code is being first converted to HTML, and then it continues with the process detailed above. Converting Markdown code to HTML was made possible through the Markdig \cite{markdig} library.

\subsection{Managing Git repositories with LibGit2}

Git repository management has been added to Pie in order to offer developers a way to backup their files \cite{git} and keep track of all the changes related to their projects. Users can also push their local repositories to remote locations, in order to ensure that data is never lost, in case of an unfortunate event. Even if Pie's main focus is simplicity, integrating (local + remote) Git support is an essential feature, services like GitHub being used heavily nowadays \cite{github-usage}.

Pie has been programmed initially to use the user's local installation of Git. However, I soon decided to switch to LibGit2Sharp \cite{libgit2sharp}, a C\# implementation of libgit2 \cite{libgit2}, that allowed me to better handle repository metadata and provide Pie with a pre-installed VCS management tool. Users don't need to install Git separately anymore. Pie saved them 3 minutes of their life, which now can be spent on debugging.

\subsection{Querying databases with various SQL drivers}

Pie's persistence layer is implemented through various database drivers, all wrapped over layers that suit C\# applications well. At this moment, Pie supports three types of relational databases: MySQL, Microsoft SQL and PostgreSQL. User-submitted queries are processed by either mysql-connector-net \cite{mysql-driver}, Microsoft's vanilla SQL driver, or the Npgsql \cite{npgsql-driver} library. This depends on the RDBMS (relational database management system) picked by the user during the connection setup phase.

NoSQL databases become more popular each day, but every non-relational database is built different. This means that various APIs or additional logic needs to be implemented, and this is already out of scope for my project. Pie doesn't intend to substitute database management apps. It was intended to implement simple querying functionality, as code editors and even SQL clients require more configuration than needed for such a process. In comparison, NoSQL database systems such as MongoDB provide simpler tools that are easy to install and to use (MongoDB Compass). At this moment, there is no "universal" database client that provides support for multiple non-relational database systems, and implementing such a tool takes a lot of effort.
